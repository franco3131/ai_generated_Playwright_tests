This Playwright automation requires an open AI Key in the ai/generateTest.js file. Need to replace the  process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY variable.
When creating the tests, i ran promps such as 'create several edge case scenarios' and a file is generated
I used command like 'node ai/generateTest.js "create several similar tests based on the template"'
